            <h2>An American graphic designer</h2>
            <p>
                Born on 26 June 1929, Glaser died exactly 91 years later on his birthday in New York, where he had lived all his life.  Some of his best known work includes "I Love NY", and the psychedelic 1966 poster for Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits album.

            <figcaption>Up until his death on 26 June 2020, Glaser was working on a graphic project that would represent the idea of collectivity during the forced isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic.</figcaption>
                <p>As the artist told the New York Times, he hoped that the project, titled Together, would be distributed to public schools across the city to spread the message that "we are not alone".
                "'We're all in this together' has been reiterated a thousand times, but you can create the symbolic equivalent of that phrase by just using the word 'together', and then making those letters [look] as though they are all different, but all related," he told the publication.</p>
